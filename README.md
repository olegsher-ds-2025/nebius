Welcome, and thank you for your interest in the AI Performance Engineering course, starting on March 17 in Tel Aviv.

 

We’re inviting you to complete the admission assignment designed to help you understand whether the course is a good fit for your background, while also giving us a clearer sense of your experience. Also, please keep in mind that the course will be held entirely in English.

 

Working on our practical task, you'll build a simple API service that takes a GitHub repository URL and returns a human-readable summary of the project.

Please plan for 4 to 7 hours approximately to complete the admission assignment (depending on the tools and your experience). Make sure to complete it by February 28.
